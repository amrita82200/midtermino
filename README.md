Hello!
This is the midterm I was able to come up with. I tried my best on each of the tasks but I had a lot of issues. I would make/modify code and run it and it would work, but then I wouldn't change anything and then it wouldn't work. There were a lot of issues with the different IDE's that had very minisule and specific fixes. I had to uninstal and reinstal multiple things and had to restart my progress many times. I did the very best that I could, followed the tutorials/tools/resources as given. I learned a lot about the realities of app development, but just have a lot of errors in the code trying to get it all together with the technology bugging out. 
Everything should run from lib/main.dart
